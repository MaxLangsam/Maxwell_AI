- `GET /api/insights/digest` - Weekly thought digest
- `GET /api/stats` - User statistics

## Second Brain Architecture

Maxwell's Second Brain system works through several layers:

1. **Input Processing**: All user interactions are converted to vector embeddings
2. **Pattern Detection**: Algorithms identify recurring themes and behaviors
3. **Memory Formation**: Important information is stored in long-term memory
4. **Insight Generation**: AI analyzes patterns to generate actionable insights
5. **Contextual Retrieval**: Related thoughts are surfaced during conversations

## Deployment

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Enable the `vector` extension:
\`\`\`sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
\`\`\`

3. Run the migration file to create all tables and policies
4. Set up authentication providers (email, Google, etc.)
5. Configure RLS policies for data security

### Vercel Deployment

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy with automatic builds on push

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Usage

### Getting Started with Maxwell

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account using email or social login
2. **Start Chatting**: Begin a conversation with Maxwell
3. **Add Tasks**: Use natural language to create tasks ("Remind me to call mom")
4. **Take Notes**: Capture thoughts and ideas
5. **Schedule Events**: "Schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 2pm"
6. **Review Insights**: Check the insights panel for patterns and suggestions

### Natural Language Commands

Maxwell understands various natural language patterns:

- **Tasks**: "Add task: finish presentation", "üî• urgent: submit report"
- **Reminders**: "Remind me to call mom at 3pm", "Set reminder for tomorrow"
- **Notes**: "Note: great idea for weekend project", "Journal: feeling productive today"
- **Calendar**: "Schedule meeting with team next Monday at 10am"
- **Memory**: "/forget about old project", "Remember that I prefer morning meetings"

Perfect! I've integrated a complete full-stack backend with Supabase for Maxwell. Here's what's been implemented:

## üóÑÔ∏è **Complete Database Schema**
- **10 Core Tables**: Users, chat sessions, messages, tasks, notes, reminders, calendar events, memories, embeddings, and insights
- **Vector Support**: pgvector extension for semantic embeddings
- **Row Level Security**: Complete RLS policies for data protection
- **Automatic Triggers**: Updated timestamps and user creation handling

## üîê **Authentication System**
- **Supabase Auth**: Email/password and social login support
- **Middleware**: Session management and route protection
- **Auth Provider**: React context for user state management
- **Auto User Creation**: Automatic user profile creation on signup

## üöÄ **Complete API Layer**
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Full CRUD operations for all entities
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript types for database schema
- **Error Handling**: Proper error responses and validation
- **Security**: User-scoped data access with RLS

## üìä **Advanced Features**
- **User Statistics**: Database function for analytics
- **Memory Cleanup**: Automatic expired memory cleanup
- **Insight Generation**: AI-powered pattern detection
- **Weekly Digests**: Comprehensive thought analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è **Production Ready**

- Store and retrieve all their data (tasks, notes, calendar, etc.)
- Benefit from AI insights and pattern recognition
- Access their data through a type-safe API

All data is properly secured with Row Level Security, and the system scales automatically with Supabase's infrastructure. The Second Brain functionality now has persistent storage, making Maxwell a truly powerful personal AI assistant!
